description: "the archetypal plant, ancestor to all plants"
---

<p>Goethe's archetypal plant. understood first as a literal historical ancestor to all plants (which may well have existed at some point), and later as the schema of 'plantness'</p>
<p><blockquote>With this model and the key to it, it will be possible to go on forever inventing plants and know that their existence is logical; that is to say, if they do not actually exist, they could, for they are not the shadow phantoms of vain imagination, but possess an inner necessity and truth.</blockquote></p>
